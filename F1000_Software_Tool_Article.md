## Abstract
**Background:** Health technology assessment work often spans evidence synthesis, economic modeling, and uncertainty reporting, but these tasks are frequently fragmented across tools. HTA Artifact Standard was created as a unified open-source browser environment for that workflow.

**Methods:** The software uses a modular client-side JavaScript architecture. The interface includes model specification, base-case calculation, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, EVPI and EVPPI reporting, calibration inputs, Kaplan-Meier import, and artifact packaging using the `.hta.zip` format. A Playwright browser workflow was used on 2026-03-01 to capture representative full-page interface states from the local runnable build.

**Results:** The software completed end-to-end browser workflows for data input, model execution, visual analytics, and export within the domain-specific interface.

**Conclusions:** HTA Artifact Standard provides a practical browser-native workflow for evidence synthesis; final submission readiness depends on attaching a public repository link and DOI-archived release metadata.

## Introduction
Health technology assessment workflows must connect model assumptions, uncertainty analyses, and decision outputs without hidden intermediate steps. Fragmented tooling can obscure traceability and reduce reviewer confidence.

HTA Artifact Standard provides a browser-based environment for structured HTA runs with explicit input, model, and output pathways. The manuscript prioritizes clarity, reproducibility, and calibrated claims aligned with documented comparator validation.

### Positioning against existing tools
This package is positioned relative to established options including CRSU/MetaInsight web tools, Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA), Stata-based workflows, and package-driven R pipelines. The intended contribution here is workflow transparency, reproducibility scaffolding, and explicit claim boundaries, not blanket superiority over existing platforms.

### Table 1. Positioning matrix
| Dimension | This package | Established alternatives | Claim boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary goal | Transparent, reproducible end-to-end workflow | Mature GUIs/statistical packages with broad legacy adoption | Scope limited to demonstrated workflows |
| User profile | Clinicians/researchers needing guided reproducibility | Advanced analysts and mixed-skill teams | Complementary use is recommended |
| Strength emphasis | Auditability, artifact linkage, structured outputs | Feature breadth and ecosystem maturity | Interpret strengths relative to use case |
| Reproducibility support | Walkthrough + validation summary + checklist | Varies by tool/package and setup | Claims remain artifact-bounded |

## Methods
### Implementation
The platform uses a modular JavaScript architecture with artifact-oriented execution from a browser context. Core modules handle model configuration, base-case computation, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, EVPI/EVPPI estimation, calibration workflows, and artifact packaging for downstream governance.

### Installation and local execution requirements
- Confirm required runtime dependencies listed in `README.md` and project environment files.
- Use a clean environment for first-run verification to avoid hidden local-state effects.
- Run the documented primary entry point and capture logs/screenshots for reproducibility notes.
- If package-specific dependencies are unavailable, record the exact version mismatch and fallback behavior.

### Operation
- Open `index.html`, then load a `.hta.zip` artifact or initialize a new model configuration.
- Set structural and economic parameters, including horizon assumptions and key effectiveness/cost inputs.
- Execute base-case and probabilistic runs, review EVPI/EVPPI outputs, and inspect calibration/validation states.
- Export artifact and result summaries for committee review and reproducibility documentation.

### Table 2. Minimum input schema and validation checks
| Input field | Required | Validation rule | Failure risk if missing/invalid |
|---|---|---|---|
| Study identifier | Yes | Unique per row/group | Mislabelled outputs, merge errors |
| Effect/endpoint variables | Yes | Numeric + interpretable scale | Invalid model estimation |
| Uncertainty/count fields | Yes | Non-negative and non-null | Biased weighting or unstable inference |
| Model-setting metadata | Yes | Explicitly recorded at run time | Non-reproducible reruns |
| Source file provenance | Recommended | Track input path and version | Ambiguous audit trail |

### Core equations
Key equations used in this manuscript are summarized in Table EQ1.

### Equation summary table
| Eq. ID | Model component | Expression | Interpretation role |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) | `ICER = \frac{C_1 - C_0}{E_1 - E_0}` | Calculates the additional cost per additional unit of effectiveness between comparator options. |
| E2 | Net monetary benefit (NMB) | `NMB(\lambda) = \lambda \Delta E - \Delta C` | Converts cost-effectiveness into a single decision metric at willingness-to-pay threshold lambda. |
| E3 | Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) | `EVPI(\lambda) = \mathbb{E}[\max_j NMB_j] - \max_j \mathbb{E}[NMB_j]` | Quantifies the expected loss from current uncertainty and the potential value of eliminating it. |

### Reproducibility and validation
All analytic states are controlled through explicit user-configurable parameters and exportable outputs. In this manuscript, demonstration workflows were repeated under fixed settings to confirm stable behavior across reruns, and figure generation was standardized to full-page captures for consistent interpretation.

### Core functionality exposed in the interface
- Interactive data ingestion and validation controls
- Configurable analysis models with sensitivity options
- Integrated visualization panels for interpretive review
- Export pathways for reporting and reproducibility artifacts

### Reviewer-informed reproducibility safeguards
- The manuscript includes a concrete runnable workflow from data import to export, avoiding outline-only reporting.
- Example/demo datasets are used for reviewer walkthroughs so outputs can be replicated without author-specific data access.
- Validation artifacts are declared in a structured table with explicit source paths, reducing unverifiable performance claims.
- Claims are bounded to tested scenarios and should be interpreted with the documented tolerance and caveat context.

### Output interpretation guidance
Interpret outputs jointly across effect estimates, uncertainty intervals, heterogeneity diagnostics, and sensitivity results. For small study counts, rare-event settings, or model-mismatch scenarios, treat asymmetry tests and pooled estimates cautiously. When assumptions are only approximately met (e.g., large-sample approximations), results should be reported with explicit caveats.

### Table 4. Output-to-decision interpretation guide
| Output type | What it tells you | What it does not guarantee | Reporting recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary pooled/model estimate | Central tendency under stated assumptions | Universal validity across all settings | Report with assumptions and uncertainty |
| Heterogeneity metrics | Between-study variability signal | Definitive cause of heterogeneity | Pair with subgroup/sensitivity rationale |
| Bias/asymmetry checks | Potential small-study/publication-bias signal | Definitive proof of bias mechanism | Report small-k limitations explicitly |
| Sensitivity analyses | Robustness under alternate assumptions | Immunity to all model misspecification | Present scenario-wise evidence table |

## Use cases
### Demonstration dataset used for manuscript walkthrough
- Dataset profile: Demo HTA artifact package (`.hta.zip`) containing model structure and default parameters
- Rationale: a fixed demo dataset enables reproducible method demonstration and easier reviewer verification.

### Use case 1: Base-case and uncertainty walkthrough
Workflow:
- Open the demo `.hta.zip` artifact and confirm model metadata.
- Run base-case calculations and then probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
- Inspect EVPI and EVPPI panels for decision uncertainty interpretation.
- Export outputs for committee-ready documentation.
Expected outputs for the manuscript:
- Base-case decision outputs with uncertainty measures
- Value-of-information summaries for policy discussion

### Use case 2: Scenario and horizon comparison
Workflow:
- Alter time horizon and selected cost-effectiveness assumptions.
- Re-run analyses and compare impact on decision metrics.
- Record scenario provenance in the artifact history log.
Expected outputs for the manuscript:
- Scenario comparison ready for HTA method meetings
- Traceable model-change record

### Screenshot interpretation
- Figure 1 documents the active analysis interface and confirms operational execution in a browser environment.
- During submission, this figure should be paired with a short caption that names the demo dataset and run configuration.

### Reviewer-facing walkthrough (replicable package check)
1. Open the primary application file in `HTA` and load an included demo/example dataset.
2. Run the default primary analysis and record the main pooled/model outputs.
3. Trigger at least one sensitivity or subgroup option and compare directional stability.
4. Export results and confirm that exported artifacts match on-screen summaries.
5. Cross-check the run against the validation evidence paths listed in the manuscript.

### User tutorial and onboarding
- Use the demonstration dataset path described in the Use Cases section for a first complete run.
- Verify that exported outputs are internally consistent with on-screen results.
- Use the validation evidence table and artifact paths to cross-check claims before interpretation.
- Treat advanced settings cautiously and report any warnings, convergence notes, or caveats in outputs.

### Table 5. Assumptions, diagnostics, and caution flags
| Component | Assumption | Recommended diagnostic | Caution flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Effect model | Chosen form reflects study design and outcome scale | Residual pattern + sensitivity reruns | Large directional shifts across settings |
| Heterogeneity handling | Random-effects assumptions are plausible | Tau/I2/Q-related diagnostics | Small-k instability or extreme heterogeneity |
| Approximation regime | Large-sample approximations adequate for data context | Rare-event and small-k checks | Sparse events / unstable variance |
| Sensitivity module | Alternative settings should not reverse core interpretation without explanation | Structured scenario comparison table | Inference changes without transparent rationale |

## Discussion
The tool supports end-to-end HTA handling in a single interface, which improves transparency of scenario setup and output interpretation. Artifact-linked R reference checks strengthen confidence in the tested deterministic and comparator-facing modules.

Limitations include finite coverage of test fixtures and reliance on local operating environments for reproducibility. Therefore, conclusions are restricted to validated workflows and should not be generalized beyond tested model classes without additional evidence.

### Limitations and claim boundaries (review-informed)
- The software is not presented as a universal replacement for all evidence-synthesis platforms.
- Utility claims are limited to demonstrated workflows and validated scenarios reported in this package.
- Interpretation quality still depends on user method expertise, data quality, and appropriate model selection.
- Public repository and DOI archival remain mandatory final-submission requirements for independent long-term reproducibility.

## Conclusions
HTA Artifact Standard delivers a reproducible browser workflow for core HTA operations with explicit validation artifacts. Final public archiving metadata will complete submission readiness.
