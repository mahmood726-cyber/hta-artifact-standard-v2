## `[475]` HTA Artifact Standard: An Open-Source Platform with 41 Analytical Engines for Health Technology Assessment

**Type:** methods  |  ESTIMAND: ICER, NMB, and pooled treatment effects  
**Data:** An open-source browser platform with 41 HTA engines and 3,337 automated tests, matching R outputs to a maximum absolute error of 4.72e-5.

### 156-word body

How can health technology assessment analysts unify economic modeling, evidence synthesis, and uncertainty analysis within one open-source platform? HTA Artifact Standard implements 41 engines spanning Markov simulation, microsimulation, discrete event simulation, partitioned survival, pairwise and network meta-analysis, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and value-of-information computation. Deterministic reproducibility is enforced through a PCG32 seeded pseudo-random generator, Kahan compensated summation, and IEEE 754 compliance, producing identical outputs from the same seed. The validation suite comprises 3,337 automated tests across unit, integration, property-based, stress, and performance categories, with Markov and OR pooling fixtures matching R outputs to a maximum absolute error within CI bounds of 4.72e-5. Eight meta-analysis benchmarks against R metafor and four publication bias validations passed within specified tolerances. The platform provides a unified, transparent, reproducible HTA workflow accessible to analysts without commercial software licenses. Scope is bounded to the 41 implemented engines; emerging methods such as federated survival analysis and adaptive platform trial simulation are not yet supported.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in
  the protocol document linked above.

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

Competing interests: MA serves on the editorial board of Synthēsis (the
  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

Reporting checklist: PRISMA 2020 (methods-paper variant — reports on review corpus).

Target journal: ◆ Synthēsis (https://www.synthesis-medicine.org/index.php/journal)
  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
